## WireSpy enables the automation of various WiFi attacks to conduct Man-In-The-Middle-Attacks (MITMAs).
**WireSpy** allows attackers to set up quick honeypots to carry out **MITMAs**. Monitoring and logging functionality is implemented in order to keep records of the victims' traffic/activities. Other tools can be used together with Wirespy to conduct more advanced attacks. 

Two type of attacks are supported at the moment:
* **Evil twin**: Force victims to auto-connect to the honeypot by spoofing a *"trusted"* hotspot (clone an existing access point and de-authenticate its users to force them to transparently connect to the spoofed honeypot).
* **Honeypot**: Set up a simple rogue hotspot and wait for clients to connect.

## Features
* Capture victims' traffic.
* MAC address spoofing.
* Set-up honeypot and evil twin attacks.
* Show the list of in range access points.
* Wireless adapter|card|dongle power amplification.

## Usage
1. Make the script executable:
```console
$ chmod +x wirespy.sh
```
2. Run the script with root privileges:
```console
$ sudo ./wirespy.sh
```
3. Type `help` to display the list of available commands.

### Available commands
```shell
Attacks:
    eviltwin      > launch an evil twin attack
    honeypot      > launch a rogue access point attack

Commands:
    clear         > clear the terminal
    help          > list available commands
    quit|exit     > exit the program
    apscan        > show all wireless access points nearby
    leases        > display DHCP leases
    powerup       > power wireless interface up (may cause issues)
    start capture > start packet capture (tcpdump)
    stop capture  > stop packet capture (tcpdump)
    status        > show modules status
```

## Possible Improvements
- [ ] Add WPA/WPA2 support for honeypot.
- [ ] Bash autocompletion.
- [x] Optimise the source code.
- [x] Improve the stability.
- [x] Improve the UI (e.g. uniformise the style and colors).
- [x] Show the status of processes running in the background.
- [ ] Validate all user inputs against regexes.

## Project Information
This script was developed in the context of my master thesis work in June 2015.

The project was presented on Pentester Academy TV's toolbox in 2017:

Work on a new improved version has commenced in 2018.
